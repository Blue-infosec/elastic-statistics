# Elasticsearch cluster monitor using Grafana/Kibana

Using stats API, it is simple to get very useful elastic node(s) statistic . Please refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-stats.html for more details.

This python script uses stats API to periodically poll the elastic cluster and get important cluster parameters for determining cluster health.

## Installation

### create the index
```
$ sh elastic-statistics-template.sh
```

### run the script
```
$ python elastic-statistics.py 
```
on one of the elastic cluster nodes.

Run it through unix crontab to start executing it periodically and generate elastic cluster statistics.

## Notes: 
* You need to create index first before running the elastic cluster statistics script.
* The statistics for an elastic node are indexed under a single type, identified by the nodeâ€™s name. It is recommended to use fixed node names, otherwise any restart of elasticsearch will generate new node names and statistics for the node will be indexed under different types. So, be careful!!

## To-do
* Instead of cron, run the script using built-in python scheduler and control its run through supervisor daemon.
* Use curator to delete the old statistics
* Visualize elastic cluster statistics using Grafana/Kibana.

## Thank you
* The following Elastic discussion thread was useful to show bulk indexing using python:
